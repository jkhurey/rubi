    <div class="content"><h2>NORMAN LEWIS THE ARTIST AMERICA NEEDED BUT DIDN'T WANT</h2></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Abstract expressionism transmuted during the aftermath of WWII, America was now the main act on the world’s stage. Democracy’s victory over fascism proved that America’s ideals were supreme and other countries should look towards the west for guidance during Europe’s rebuild. Quickly following America’s optimistic drink came the hangover of the red scare brought in by the cold war. The only thing more freighting than a known enemy is an unknown one with enemies of the nation now being things as abstract as ideals lead to paranoia. Anything could be a war on democracy even including the television programs you’re watching or radio stations you are tuned into. Democracy of course would not just stand and watch as war had been declared on the freedom of the people and the gleaming future of corporate America. Institutions of America felt a call to action and were determined to answer the question of what is American? As we all know what comes with centralized power, bias against those who do not represent them or occupy the exclusive air above the glass ceiling. Enter in Abstract Expressionism, brought in part by design, and part by the red scare tight rope of what was deemed American commentary.</p>
    <p>Frances k. Pohl commented in Framing America “As artists grappled with questions of subject matter and style in the late 1940s, critics worked to construct a new image of modernist art….”[4] During the red scare institutions ranging from the MoMa to CIA-funded art shows raced to proclaim what was the proper direction for American modern art. As many institutions of today even more in the 1940-1950s were run by straight white males leading to the issue of lack of diverse perspectives. The CIA attempted with no prevail to curate an art exhibition on what they deemed modern American art, accusations of the work carrying communist ideals quickly forced its shut down, and President Harry S. Truman to distance himself from the project.[5] This is just one example of the hysteria that surrounded the art movements’ fruition. In the now-famous Life magazine photograph of the Irascibles, it is very easy to spot the lack of diversity within the movement as there is just one lone female artist in the photograph as opposed to the all-white male cast. </p></div>
    <div class="content"> <p>The somewhat general consensus, if there is one, on what deems an artist to fit in the Abstract Expressionist canon seems to be a handful of interchangeable criteria. Abstract Expressionism seems to have attempted a universal style one that speaks on the psychological and spiritual condition of humanity. One can say it is an extreme take on romanticism, a dive into the nontangible. Artists looked to what they considered primitive references[6], a time when man was more connected to their inner self and the universe. A time before industrialization and the implementation of social constructs. Artists like Jackson Pollock were celebrated for their primal approach, art critic Rudi Blesh stated “... They are built like athletes, and some of them, like Pollock and De Kooning, paint-like athletes. If pictures could explode, theirs would …”[7] Masculinity was celebrated to be violent and primal, with those descriptions what would be considered American modern art excluded many.</p>
      <p>America was supposedly a utopian beacon, a nation of democracy where everyone was free to be and could be what one’s heart desired to be, the American dream. With those claims and aspirations, one would think if America truly wanted to demonstrate those claims they would embrace a perspective not normally given a platform. Norman Lewis was an artist that demonstrated both, abstract ideals painted on two-dimensional planes as well as comments on social inequalities. Norman Lewis at his essence was the artist America so desperately proclaimed they supported. He was the only African American artist in the MoMA meeting that defined the parameters of the Abstract Expressionist Movement.[8] Norman sat in the middle not fully being embraced by his African American peers because of his decision to separate himself from representational painting, and not being embraced by the art critics because of not fitting the racial mold of the times. </p>

      <p>You would be fairly hard-pressed to find many critics in the 1950s citing Norman Lewis’s work as one of the faces of the Abstract Expressionist movements but fast forward to 2021 his work is the cover of the MoMa’s Abstract Expressionist exhibition. The MoMa was one of the very influential institutions that adopted and embraced the movement specifically artists like Jackson Pollock, Norman Rockwell, and William De Kooning.</p>
      <p>Let us hone in on the Norman Lewis piece that graces the website cover of MoMa’s 401: Out of War exhibition, PhantasyII. Phantasy II was an attempt by Norman Lewis to capture the movement’s musical counterpart, improv Jazz. Phantasy II embodies the movement and action celebrated by fans of the Abstract Expressionist movement. The painting’s bold and playful colors move across the canvas at a musical tempo bleeding into each other with harmonious respect. The piece displays sharp movement with diagonal lines as well as horizontal and vertical lines only exposing themselves when the viewer hones in on spaces within the piece akin to the importance of time in regards to music. The piece being both sophisticated and removed from any political statement, in theory, seems like a slam dunk for what American institutions were looking for to represent the movement.

      <p>Phantasy II is the America the United States wanted to embody, a celebration of sophistication, a celebration of intellectual freedom. To understand the piece you have to understand the premise of the improv jazz movements. The ideology is founded on freedom while also maintaining structural integrity, being given free rein while also living harmoniously amongst your counterparts. In order to be successful within the arena, you must have an intrinsic understanding of your medium. Phantasy II displayed those complexities, Norman Lewis successfully captured a time-based medium of music and translated it onto a two-dimensional plane.</p>
      <p>Norman Lewis made a point early on to stray away from directly political comments within his pieces. The double standards or maybe one can even say the hypocrisy that shrouded the movement allowed for statements such as Rothko and Gottlieb’s letter that stated “spiritual kinship with primitive and archaic art”[11] while on the same token dismissed Native, African American, and Female artworks as autobiographical thus being incapable of being universally commentating. I believe these constraints caused Norman Lewis to focus on works that fit within the constantly morphing mold. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Towards the tail end of the movement, Norman Lewis unveiled what many consider his Magnus opus American Totem 1960 found in The Whitney Museum. The piece takes a more direct approach politically, utilizing one of an artist’s strongest assets, their unique perspective. The work is energetic, abstract, and possibly what they would consider primitive. The work seems to be a shake off of all constraints placed on him by the movement. To be shown alongside the contemporaries he wished to be with is like coming full circle.[12] It can be seen as ironic that what the movement considered a weakness for African American artists became Norman Lewis’s strongest asset as only one with personal experience could have an intrinsic comment such as American Totem.</p>
      <p>W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in his essay Striving of the Negro People “One feels his two-ness, — an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.”[13] This brilliant excerpt strums up what Norman Lewis may have felt during the beginnings of the Abstract Expressionism movement. The rules of the movement were not made for fairness but to keep his work as othered. I believe this pushed him to strive for undisputable heights which in my opinion he reached. It can be argued that the pressures allowed him to understand the movement far more than many of his contemporaries. </p>
